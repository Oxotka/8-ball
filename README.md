# 8-ball
8-ball app for iPhone (swift course)

App with int.random() and animate()
I create it for learning Swift.

**Functional:**
- When app starts, a usage hint is shown
- When you shake device, the app shows you a random prediction
- When you tap on label, the app shows you a random prediction
- New prediction animated with "alpha" property
- The image position is adapted for devices with align and constraint


**Notes:**
- Icon and ball image were drawn by me in ProCreate
- The background has been downloaded from web
- I can't animate a shaking ball. I tried to do it with changing center.x and center.y, but it is not a good-looking.
